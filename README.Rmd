# RedisAPI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/RedisAPI.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/RedisAPI)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error=FALSE)
```

Automatically generated R6 interface to the full [Redis](http://redis.io) API.  The generated functions are faithful to the Redis [documentation](http://redis.io/commands) while attempting to match R's argument and vectorisation semantics.

As of version `0.3.0` RedisAPI supports binary serialisation of almost anything; keys, values, etc.  Just don't expect Redis to do anything sensible with the values - you won't be able to compute on directly.

This package is designed primarily to work with driver packages that are not yet on CRAN: [redux](https://github.com/richfitz/redux) and [`rrlite`](https://github.com/ropensci/rrlite), but support for RcppRedis is included.

```{r}
con <- RedisAPI::redis_api(RedisAPI::rcppredis_connection())
```

That connection has many (`r length(grep("^[A-Z]", ls(con)))`) methods. Automatically generated methods are in all-caps, following the Redis documentation.  Unlike Redis commands are *case sensitive*.

```r
con
## <redis_api>
##   Public:
##     APPEND: function
##     AUTH: function
##     BGREWRITEAOF: function
##     BGSAVE: function
##     ...
##     ZSCORE: function
##     ZUNIONSTORE: function
```

The methods are designed to be straightforward to use following the Redis documentation.  For example, the Redis [`HMSET`](http://redis.io/commands/hmset) command is defined as

```
HMSET key field value [field value ...]
```

which sets one or more `field` / `value` pairs within a hash stored at a `key`.  In `RedisAPI`, the generated interface has arguments

```{r}
args(con$HMSET)
```

where `key` is a scalar and `field` / `value` are vectors of the same non-zero length (these requirements are enforced at runtime).

Because `RedisAPI` objects are `R6` objects, access methods using `$`:

```{r}
con$HMSET("myhash", c("a", "b", "c"), c(1, 2, 3))
con$HGET("myhash", "b")
```

Note that no clever type conversion will be done; R types are converted to strings and are not converted back when returned.

There are some sub-command-style Redis commands with spaces in them (e.g., `CLIENT KILL`, `SCRIPT LOAD`; these are implemented by replacing spaces with underscores to give `CLIENT_KILL` and `SCRIPT_LOAD`.

# Serialisation

To ease saving arbitrary R data into Redis, `RedisAPI` has two convenience functions for serialising to and deserialising from a string: `object_to_string` and `string_to_object`.

```{r}
object_to_string(2)
string_to_object("A\n2\n196866\n131840\n14\n1\n2\n")
```

This makes it easy (though reasonably verbose) to use arbitrary R values anywhere in Redis:

```{r}
con$SET(object_to_string(1:10), object_to_string(iris))
head(string_to_object(con$GET(object_to_string(1:10))))
```

String serialisation can very slightly mess with floating point numbers, but should be reasonable for many uses.

It is not supported with RcppRedis above, but the [redux](https://github.com/richfitz/redux) package allows use of binary serialisation for everything.  Use it with `redux::hiredis()`

# Advanced features

For drivers that support it pipeling is available; multiple commands are queued and sent to the Redis server at the same time.  This can greatly reduce the time to execute bulk commands because you pay only one round trip cost (see `redux` for more details and an example).

Subscription support, using Redis' `PUBLISH`/`SUBSCRIBE` interface is implemented using callback functions.  This requires support in the underlying driver (supported only by `redux`).

# rlite support

If [`rrlite`](https://github.com/ropensci/rrlite) is installed, you can create hirlite connections with `rrlite::hirlite()` which has the same set of generated interfaces.  Not all commands are supported (for example, `SCAN` and `BLPOP`) but `hirlite` will throw an error if unsupported commands are used.

# Documentation

There is a vignette (`vignette("RedisAPI")`) that outlines the basic idea.  Source is [here](vignette/RedisAPI.Rmd), and rendered [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/RedisAPI/master/inst/doc/RedisAPI.html)
